In this notebook, I model Anthropocene Project using cadCAD tool. This was the capstone project for the cadCAD Bootcamp (Beginner Level) course that I finished. The main reason of taking this course is to better porepare myself for the upcoming blockchain research where we explore Ethereum and layer 2 blockchain economics. 

`anthropocene-cadCAD-notebook-v0` is my first attemp on this capstone project. I did finish most of the part from scratch, but there were still some pieces that I did not do a good job. This resulted in `anthropocene-cadCAD-notebook-v1` version of the notebook where I mainly improve the modeling by including parameter sweep aspect.

The main lesson I learned by comparing my first attempt and the solutions provided by the course is that I should create a model for simulation using as broad papameter setting as possible and run it once. Once I have a comprehensive simulation output, I can asnwer all sorts of questions without re-running or modifying the model.
